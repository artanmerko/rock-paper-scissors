# JavaScript PROJECT: Rock-Paper-Scissors
## About
Rock, paper, and scissors game is a simple fun game in which both the players have to make a rock, paper, or scissors. It has only two possible outcomes a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other player. I've designed the game using JavaScript where a player will be playing against the computer. The player has to choose one option among the rock, paper, and scissors. A random option will be generated from the computer’s side and the one who wins will get one point every time.

Requirements
1. Start a new Git repo for your project.
2. Create a blank HTML document with a script tag
3. Your game is going to play against the computer, so begin with a function called computerPlay that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play.
